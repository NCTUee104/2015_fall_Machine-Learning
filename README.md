### Course descriptions :
Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is a scientific discipline concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data from sensor data or databases. A major focus is to automatically learn to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions based on data. This course shall deliver fundamental theories of machine learning which can be applied for many intelligent information systems.
